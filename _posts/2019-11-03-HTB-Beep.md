### Initial Enumeration

#### 1. Nmap Scanning

Starting with a scan of the target ip address:

`nmap -sC -sV -oA beep.nmap 10.10.10.7`

The nmap scan shows multiple open ports. Let's open up the web browser and investigate.
We are redirected to a HTTPS website running Elastix.

In the meantime, we will run a gobuster scan to find any more directories:

#### 2. Gobuster Scanning

``gobuster dir -u https://10.10.10.7/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 100 -k``

Let's load up searchsploit and take a quick look to see if there are any exploits available for Elastix.


### Exploitation

#### 3. LFI Exploit

We see there are multiple exploits, the most interesting one is the LFI and Remote Code Execution. So let's give that one a shot.

[EDB-ID:37637](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/37637)

Reading the exploit, we see the location of the LFI, which is the **/vtigercrm** directory. That lines up with what we see in our gobuster results too.

So let's copy it into the browser and see the result...

``https://10.10.10.7/vtigercrm/graph.php?current_language=../../../../../../../..//etc/amportal.conf%00&module=Accounts&action``

We got something, but it's not rendered so we can simply look at the source code.

We see many usernames / passwords for FreePBX which we can access using the admin account.

#### 4. Flag Capture

As noted in the nmap scan, port 22 is open so let's test the admin account out there.

Using the **AMPDBPASS**:
Admin doesn't seem to work  for SSH but what if the password is reused for root? After trying root we see the password worked!
Password reuse is a common vulnerability on some other boxes as well.

Letâ€™s grab the user flag which is located at the home folder of the user "fanis" as user.txt

The root flag is located
