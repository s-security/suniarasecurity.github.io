  Master Decryption Keys for GandCrab, versions 4
  through 5.2
  Summary
  On 17 June 2019, the FBI, in partnership with law enforcement
  agencies from 8 European countries, as well as Europol and
  BitDefender, released a decryption tool applicable to all versions of
  GandCrab ransomware. The decryption tool can be found at
  www.nomoreransom.org. The collaborative efforts further identified
  the master decryption keys for all new versions of GandCrab
  introduced since July 2018. The FBI is releasing the master keys in
  order to facilitate the development of additional decryption tools.
  GandCrab operates using a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) business
  model, selling the right to distribute the malware to affiliates in
  exchange for 40% of the ransoms. GandCrab was first observed in
  January 2018 infecting South Korean companies, but GandCrab
  campaigns quickly expanded globally to include US victims in early
  2018, impacting at least 8 critical infrastructure sectors. As a result,
  GandCrab rapidly rose to become the most prominent affiliate-based
  ransomware, and was estimated to hold 50% of the ransomware
  market share by mid-2018. Experts estimate GandCrab infected over
  500,000 victims worldwide, causing losses in excess of $300 million.
