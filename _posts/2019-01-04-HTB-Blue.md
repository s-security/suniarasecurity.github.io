* Box: Blue
  - Difficulty: Easy
  - Points: 20
  - Release: 28 Jul 2017
  - IP: 10.10.10.40

### Initial Enumeration

#### 1. Nmap Scanning

Starting with a scan of the target ip address:

`nmap -sC -sV -oA blue.nmap 10.10.10.40`

Based on the output of the nmap scan we can determine this is a Windows machine. Ports 135,139 and 445.
We also see a potential username "Haris"

The OS looks to be "Windows 7 SP1 7601 Build".

Based on the name of this box and the SMB port being open, this box will potentially require an EternalBlue exploit.

#### 2. SMB Enumeration

We can run **smbmap** to see if we have access to any network shares with the anonymous user.

`smbmap -H 10.10.10.40 -u anonymous`

### Exploitation

#### 3. EternalBlue Exploit

Let's use Metasploit and load up the following module:

`exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue`

Set your **LHOST** and **RHOST**. Then run it and it will immediately grant a root shell.

Grab the flags:

- User flag is at `c:\Users\haris\Desktop\user.txt`
- Root flag is at `c:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt`
