I"Ö<p>Below are some WireShark commands that I find useful.
Wireshark is an excellent tool for system administrators and penetration testers to capture traffic on a network.</p>

<p><strong>Is your traffic efficient?</strong>
Use the following filter to identify problems in your traffic:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>tcp.analysis.flags
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This flag helps to look at problems you may have in a trace file.  By using this filter, you can see re-transmissions, acknowledgement problems and more.</p>

<p><strong>Are you seeing latency in traffic to a server or do you believe youâ€™re being SYN attacked?</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>tcp.flags.syn==1
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This filter will help you identify a SYN attack by recognizing the pattern of traffic that gets outputted.</p>

<p><strong>Is an application operating? Do you have the port # for the application?</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>tcp.port==443
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This will print you the stream of traffic on a specific port.</p>

<p><strong>This built-in filter will show you packets that have some kind of expert message from Wireshark</strong></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>tcp.analysis.flags
</code></pre></div></div>
